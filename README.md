# Docker
You'll use linux-specific syscalls in this challenge. so we'll run your code
_inside_ a Docker container.

Please ensure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
locally.

Next, add a [shell alias](https://shapeshed.com/unix-alias/):

```sh
alias mydocker='docker build -t mydocker . && docker run --cap-add="SYS_ADMIN" mydocker'
```

(The `--cap-add="SYS_ADMIN"` flag is required to create
[PID Namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html))

You can now execute your program like this:

```sh
mydocker run ubuntu:latest /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer echo hey
```

This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow the first time you
run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
